### Main Certification [1z0-829](https://education.oracle.com/cat%C3%A1logo-de-productos-ouexam-pexam_1z0-829/pexam_1Z0-829) exam topics
- **Handing date, time, text, numeric and boolean values**
	- Use primitives and wrapper classes including Math API, parentheses, type promotion, and casting to evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions
	- Manipulate text, including text blocks, using String and StringBuilder classes
	- Manipulate date, time, duration, period, instant and time-zone objects using Date-Time API
- **Controlling Program Flow**
	- Create program flow control constructs including if/else, switch statements and expressions, loops, and break and continue statements
- **Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach**
	- Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain the object life-cycle including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection
	- Create classes and records, and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers
	- Implement overloading, including var-arg methods
	- Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation, and make objects immutable. 
	- Use local variable type inference, including using it to define lambda parameters
	- Implement inheritance, including abstract and sealed classes. 
	- Override methods, including that of an Object class. 
	- Utilize polymorphism and type casting, and differentiate object type versus reference type. 
	- Identify object types using instanceof operator and pattern matching
	- Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods
	- Create and use enumerations with fields, methods and constructors
- **Handling Exceptions**
	- Handle exceptions using try/catch/finally, try-with-resources, and multi-catch blocks, including custom exceptions
- **Working with Arrays and Collections**
	- Create Java arrays, List, Set, Map and Deque collections, and produce, remove, update, retrieve and sort their elements
- **Working with Streams and Lambda expressions**
	- Use Java object and primitive Streams, including lambda expressions implementing functional interfaces, to produce, filter, transform, consume, and sort data
	- Perform decomposition, concatenation and reduction, and grouping and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams
- **Package and deploy Java code and use the Java Platform Module System**
	- Define modules and expose module content including through the use of reflection, and declare module dependencies, define services, providers and consumers
	- Compile Java code, produce modular and non-modular jars, runtime images, and implement migration using unnamed and automatic modules
- **Manage concurrent code execution**
	- Create worker threads using Runnable and Callable, manage the thread lifecycle, including automations provided by different Executor services and concurrent API
	- Develop thread-safe code, using different locking mechanisms and concurrent API
	- Process Java collections concurrently and utilise parallel streams.
- **Use Java I/O API**
	- Read and write console and file data using I/O Streams
	- Serialize and de-serialize Java objects
	- Construct, traverse, create, read, and write Path objects and their properties using java.nio.file API
- **Access databases using JDBC**
	- Create connections, create and execute basic, prepared and callable statements, process query results and control transactions using JDBC API
- **Implement Localization**
	- Implement localization using locales, resource bundles, parse and format messages, dates, times, and numbers including currency and percentage values
