# Code Formatting Guidelines

You should ensure that your code is **nicely formatted**. Pick a simple set of rules that govern the format of your code and apply them **consistently**.
If you are working on a team, agree on **one** formatting standard and have every member comply with it. An automated formatter helps enforce the style.

---

## The Purpose of Formatting

Code formatting is about **communication**, and communication is a professional developer’s first priority.
Readable, consistent style improves maintainability and extensibility long after individual lines of code have changed.

---

## Vertical Formatting

### File Length

> *Aim for files around **200 lines**, with an upper limit of about **500**.
> Smaller files are usually easier to understand than large ones.*

### The Newspaper Metaphor

* • The filename should be **simple yet descriptive**.
* • The top of the file should expose the **highest‑level concepts**; detail should increase as you move downward, ending with low‑level utilities.\*

### Vertical Openness Between Concepts

Separate distinct thoughts with **blank lines**. Most code is read left‑to‑right, top‑to‑bottom; whitespace helps readers see where one idea ends and the next begins.

### Vertical Density

Lines that are **tightly related** should sit close together.

```java
public class ReporterConfig {

  /** The class name of the reporter listener */
  private String m_className;

  /** The properties of the reporter listener */
  private List<Property> m_properties = new ArrayList<>();

  public void addProperty(Property property) {
    m_properties.add(property);
  }
}
```

### Vertical Distance

Closely related concepts belong **vertically close**—often in the same file—unless you have a compelling reason to separate them. This reduces “file hopping”.

* **Variable declarations** — place them **near their first use**.

  ```java
  private static void readPreferences() {
    InputStream is = null;
    try {
      is = new FileInputStream(getPreferencesFile());
      setPreferences(new Properties(getPreferences()));
      getPreferences().load(is);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      if (is != null) is.close();
    }
  }
  ```

* **Loop variables** — declare them **inside the loop**.

  ```java
  public int countTestCases() {
    int count = 0;
    for (Test each : tests)
      count += each.countTestCases();
    return count;
  }
  ```

* **Instance variables** — declare them at the **top of the class**.

* **Dependent functions** — if `f()` calls `g()`, place **`f()` above `g()`** when possible.

* **Conceptual affinity** — functions that perform similar work or operate on the same data belong together.

```java
public class Assert {

  public static void assertTrue(String message, boolean condition) {
    if (!condition) fail(message);
  }

  public static void assertTrue(boolean condition) {
    assertTrue(null, condition);
  }

  public static void assertFalse(String message, boolean condition) {
    assertTrue(message, !condition);
  }

  public static void assertFalse(boolean condition) {
    assertFalse(null, condition);
  }
}
```

### Vertical Ordering

Strive for a **top‑down dependency flow**: high‑level functions first, low‑level details last.

---

## Horizontal Openness and Density

Use **horizontal whitespace** to:

* **Associate** strongly related elements.
* **Separate** weakly related ones.

```java
private void measureLine(String line) {
  lineCount++;
  int lineSize = line.length();
  totalChars += lineSize;
  lineWidthHistogram.addLine(lineSize, lineCount);
  recordWidestLine(lineSize);
}
```

* No space between a method name and its `(`—they are inseparable.
* Space around `=` highlights the left side vs. right side of an assignment.
* Space after commas separates arguments.

### Operator Precedence with Whitespace

```java
public class Quadratic {

  public static double root1(double a, double b, double c) {
    double det = determinant(a, b, c);
    return (-b + Math.sqrt(det)) / (2 * a);
  }

  public static double root2(double a, double b, double c) {
    double det = determinant(a, b, c);
    return (-b - Math.sqrt(det)) / (2 * a);
  }

  private static double determinant(double a, double b, double c) {
    return b * b - 4 * a * c;
  }
}
```

Multiplication has higher precedence, so factors appear without spaces; addition/subtraction have lower precedence, so terms are separated by spaces.

### Horizontal Alignment

Avoid large columns of aligned assignments; excessively long aligned lists usually signal that the list itself is the problem.

---

## Indentation

Source files form a **hierarchy** (file → class → method → block). Indent code **one level deeper** for each nested scope:

```java
public class CommentWidget extends TextWidget {

  public static final String REGEXP =
      "^#[^\\r\\n]*(?:(?:\\r\\n)|\\n|\\r)?";

  public CommentWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) {
    super(parent, text);
  }

  public String render() throws Exception {
    return "";
  }
}
```

Good indentation visually communicates scope and structure; broken indentation obscures it.

---

Following these formatting principles helps every reader—teammates and, eventually, **future‑you**—understand the code faster and modify it with confidence.
