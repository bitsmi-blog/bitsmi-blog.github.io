### Summary
These group of posts pretend to be a quick summary to check when required to gather and review the most important concepts of the book.

It is recommended to read the book to get more detailed information about the topic that the reader wants to review.

### Introduction
For coding is not enough to gain knowledge of principles, patterns, practices and heuristics.

It requires a continuing try and failure because Clean Code is a hard work process to learn from it.

The book has been split in three main parts:

1. The first part describes the **principles, patterns and practices** of writing clean code.

2. **Study cases with different complexity**. *It will be an intense and demanding part.* Main reason why is that each case analysed is an exercise in cleaning some code that has problems and transforming it into a code with less problems than the original version.

3. **Heuristics and Smells**. It is related to the relationship between the heuristics and the discrete decisions made while doing some clean up of the source code.

As a general rule, it is recommended by the author to read the **WHOLE** book and *practice as much as possible* to gain a much richer **understanding** of these *principles, patterns and heuristics*.
