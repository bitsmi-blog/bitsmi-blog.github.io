### Clean Code.
Anyone reading this book:
1. Is a programmer.
2. Is a programmer who wants to be a better programmer.

After reading this book:
1. We will be able to tell the differences between good code and bad code.
2. We will know how to write good code.
3. We will know how to transform bad code into good keeping its business requirements.


### There will be code
Code represents the details of a requirement.

From a historical perspective, the discipline of requirements specification with well specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as a group of executable tests of that code.

### Bad code
Bad code can bring down a company.

**Wading**: Finding bad code written without being understood what is describing this code. 

If the team continues working on it but any clean approach is postponed with "We will review it later" it will never be achieved and the mess will continue to grow.

***Leblanc's Law: "Later equals never".***


### The total cost of owning a mess

**Mess** code is a natural process.

When a team is working in a code during the first years, any move in it is faster and smoother. 

Later, after some time, when trying to apply any change and trying to understand what several parts are doing, it gets more difficult to change, update or evolve the code. 

Then the **_Mess is built_**.

From this point, the team's productivity is declining to the **absolute zero** despite management tries to fix it by adding more staff who are not really aware of the inner meaning of the source code.

So as a conclusion, **_spending time_** keeping your code clean **is not only cost effective but professional survival** as a company as well as a professional programmer.

### Attitude
Despite the efforts of managers and marketers to always achieve the goals according to a narrow and specific schedule, it is part of our job to raise the hand and defend code quality with passion not only to avoid the creation of a "**mess**" short term but to get a better maintenance of the code long term.

### The Primal Conundrum
It has be understood as a **first amendment**:

**"To avoid the creation of a Mess and the only way to achieve any deadline according to a schedule is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times".**


### The Art of Clean Code
Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of myriad little techniques applied through the concept of **"cleanliness"** where the **"code-sense"** is the key.

A programmer with this **"code-sense"** will be able to confront the **"mess"** and choose the best variation preserving the transformation of the code from here to there ending in an elegantly coded system more readable and functionally working exactly as the original **mess**.
